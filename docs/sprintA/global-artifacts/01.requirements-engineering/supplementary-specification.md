# Project Supplementary Specification (FURPS+)

This document outlines the supplementary specification based on the FURPS+ model for our project, covering functionality, usability, reliability, performance, and supportability, along with design, implementation, interface, and physical constraints.

## Functionality

The system is designed to support the management of various parks owned by the organization. Key functionalities include:

- **Admin Management**: Admins manage the organization, assign jobs, and approve teams generated by the system for tasks.
- **Employee Management**: Employees have jobs, various skills, and are eventually assigned to teams to perform tasks.
- **Team Utilization**: Teams use vehicles, tools, and machines to perform tasks.
- **Task Scheduling**: Tasks are scheduled on an agenda and are performed in the parks.
- **Audit, Reporting, and Security**: Essential functions not directly related to user stories but integral to system integrity and operations.

## Usability

The system emphasizes a user-friendly interface with a focus on:

- **Error Prevention**: Validation of user credentials to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Interface Aesthetics and Design**: Two main options for login and signup, with tailored sub-menus for admin and non-admin users based on their roles and responsibilities.

## Reliability

Given the project's scope, we currently do not predict significant failures, aiming for:

- Integrity, compliance, and interoperability of the software without specifying the frequency and severity of failures or recovery mechanisms.

## Performance

[To be specified]

## Supportability

The system aims to incorporate several supportability characteristics, such as testability, adaptability, maintainability, compatibility, configurability, installability, and scalability.
