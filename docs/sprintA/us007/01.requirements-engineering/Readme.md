_US07 - As an FM,I wish to register a vehicle's check-up._

### 1.2. Customer Specifications and Clarifications 

_The client uses vehicles to carry out the tasks assigned, and are used as well to trasnport machines and equipments._

### 1.3. Acceptance Criteria

* **AC1 -** All required fields of the form must be filled before submit a vehicle for ckeck up.
* **AC2 -** Check's up date cannot be schedule before the current date.
* **AC3 -** The system allows the FM to register a vehicle’s check-up.

### 1.4. Found out Dependencies

_US007 depends on US006 - "As an FM, I wish to register a vehicle (...)" It's necessary to have a vehicle registered into the system_
before register a vehicle for check up.

### 1.5 Input and Output Data

**INPUT DATA**
* Typed Data:
  * Vehicle's ID;
  * Schedule's date;
  * Current Km's;

**OUTPUT DATA**
* (In)Success of the operation;
* km's until next check up;

### 1.6. System Sequence Diagram (SSD)

_Insert here a SSD depicting the envisioned Actor-System interactions and throughout which data is inputted and outputted to fulfill the requirement. All interactions must be numbered._

### 1.7 Other Relevant Remarks

_Use this section to capture other relevant information that is related with this US such as:  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (i) special requirements;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (ii) data and/or technology variations;  
&nbsp; &nbsp; (iii) how often this US is held._


## 2. OO Analysis

### 2.1. Relevant Domain Model Excerpt

### 2.2. Other Remarks

_Use this section to capture some aditional notes/remarks that must be taken into consideration into the design activity. In some case, it might be usefull to add other analysis artifacts (e.g. activity or state diagrams)._ 


## 3. Design - User Story Realization 

### 3.1. Rationale

**The rationale grounds on the SSD interactions and the identified input/output data.**

| Interaction ID | Question: Which class is responsible for... | Answer  | Justification (with patterns)  |
|:-------------  |:--------------------- |:------------|:---------------------------- |
| Step 1  		 |							 |             |                              |

### Systematization ##

According to the taken rationale, the conceptual classes promoted to software classes are:

* Class1
* Class2
* Class3

Other software classes (i.e. Pure Fabrication) identified:

* xxxxUI  
* xxxxController

## 3.2. Sequence Diagram (SD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML dynamic view representing the sequence of interactions between software objects that allows to fulfill the requirements._

![USXXX-SD](svg/usXXX-sequence-diagram.svg)

## 3.3. Class Diagram (CD)

_In this section, it is suggested to present an UML static view representing the main related software classes that are involved in fulfilling the requirements as well as their relations, attributes and methods._

# 4. Tests 
_In this section, it is suggested to systematize how the tests were designed to allow a correct measurement of requirements fulfilling._ 

**_DO NOT COPY ALL DEVELOPED TESTS HERE_**

**Test 1:** Check that it is not possible to create an instance of the Example class with null values. 

	@Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
		public void ensureNullIsNotAllowed() {
		Exemplo instance = new Exemplo(null, null);
	}

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._


# 5. Construction (Implementation)

_In this section, it is suggested to provide, if necessary, some evidence that the construction/implementation is in accordance with the previously carried out design. Furthermore, it is recommeded to mention/describe the existence of other relevant (e.g. configuration) files and highlight relevant commits._

_It is also recommended to organize this content by subsections._ 


# 6. Integration and Demo 

_In this section, it is suggested to describe the efforts made to integrate this functionality with the other features of the system._


# 7. Observations

_In this section, it is suggested to present a critical perspective on the developed work, pointing, for example, to other alternatives and or future related work._
